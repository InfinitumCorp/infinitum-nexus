 * then initialize in the existing Application or Activity onCreate with
 * privacy defaults: sessions, app lifecycles and screen views only; no
 * element or frustration autocapture; IP, city, DMA, lat-lng and advertising
 * IDs disabled; remote config and diagnostics off. Do not change existing
 * screens or layout.
